# Personal Portfolio Site

## Introduction
This repository hosts a registered domain through Porkbun: [justinsapun.com](https://justinsapun.com/). I built this website using Bootstrap, a free, open-source front-end development framework for static sites.
The website utilizes a combination of CSS, JS, SCSS, and HTML. I created this to showcase my engineering projects and other engagements online in detail. 

## File Structure
- Porkbun verification - CNAME
- Landing Page - index.html
- All HTML for individual pages are in the [pages](./pages) directory
- All assets including the backend, images, and videos are in the [assets](./assets) directory

## Sources
As I've never built a website or taken a web development class, I relied heavily on YouTube tutorials and free templates online.
Below are the webpage designs I used to help compile my implementation.
