            To improve the efficiency of air source heat pumps (ASHPs) in cold climates, our team explored
            integrating pulse electrothermal de-icing (PETD) technology as an alternative to traditional
            reverse cycle defrosting. We developed a series of electrical prototypes and tested them against

          <p class="text bolder">
            Air source heat pumps (ASHPs) are an increasingly popular option for residential heating due to
            their high efficiency and use of ambient air as a renewable energy source. However, in cold
            climates, frost and ice buildup on the outdoor unit severely degrades performance, forcing the
            system to periodically switch into reverse cycle defrost (RCD) mode. This interrupts heating,
            consumes energy, and stresses the mechanical system.
          </p>
          <p class="text bolder">
            Our goal was to address this limitation using Pulse Electrothermal De-icing (PETD), a patented
            technology that removes ice via short bursts of high current. Unlike RCD, PETD aims to remove
            frost without reversing the system and interrupting heating. This project explores whether PETD
            can be effectively applied to ASHP condenser coils, a nontraditional surface for this
            technology. The full report and presentation can be found below.

            Pulse Electrothermal De-icing (PETD) is a patented technology that removes ice using short,
            high-power electrical pulses. These pulses generate intense localized heating at the interface
            between the ice and the surface, melting just enough to break the bond â€” allowing gravity to
            remove the ice.
          </p>
          <p class="text bolder">
            Originally developed for smooth surfaces like airplane wings and power lines, PETD works by
            exploiting ice's electrostatic adhesion. This project explores a novel application of PETD on
            the complex surfaces of ASHP condenser coils, which introduces new electrical and thermal
            challenges.

            surface. A thin water film forms almost instantly, allowing the ice to slide off with minimal

          <p class="text bolder">
            To evaluate PETD's viability as a deicing method for ASHPs, our team divided the work into two
            major tracks: <b>Control Testing</b> and <b>Prototype Testing</b>. This parallel design approach
            allowed us to analyze both the baseline performance of a standard ASHP system and the
            effectiveness of our PETD prototype under controlled and natural icing conditions.
          </p>
          <p class="text bolder">
            The Control Testing team monitored ASHP behavior through thermistors and anemometers, measuring
            CoP, airflow, and power usage during standard, partial, and full defrost cycles. The Prototype
            Testing team focused on electrical safety, transformer performance, and de-icing behavior using
            various PETD coil prototypes in a simulated cold environment.
          </p>
          <p class="text bolder">
            By comparing energy consumption, deicing times, and thermal behavior across both test tracks,
            we aimed to determine whether PETD can offer a meaningful efficiency advantage while maintaining
            system safety and reliability.

            To understand the baseline performance of our ASHP system, we installed a Mitsubishi Hyper Heat
            indoor and outdoor unit and ran tests during real winter conditions. We tracked temperature,

            While control testing focused on understanding ASHP baseline behavior, our prototype testing
            centered around evaluating PETDâ€™s ability to deliver high-power pulses safely and effectively to
            a finned copper coil under icy conditions. We progressed through three major design stages, each
            intended to improve power delivery, reduce parasitic resistance, and ensure safe handling of
            high current.

            Our first prototype consisted of a single copper tube mounted in a 3D printed stand, with six 12
            AWG wires soldered directly to the tube. Although functional, the design suffered from high
            parasitic resistance in the wires and mechanical strain at the solder joints, limiting power
            efficiency and raising thermal concerns during operation.

          <p class="text bolder">
            To address these limitations, we moved to a 3-length coil design with custom-fabricated brass
            bus bars. These bars significantly reduced interface resistance and allowed us to clamp multiple
            conductors securely. Although brass is less conductive than copper, its availability and
            mechanical strength made it an effective intermediate solution for distributing current more
            evenly across a longer coil.

          <p class="text bolder">
            Finally, we developed a 6-length prototype using high-purity copper bus bars. These were
            soldered and mechanically fastened directly to the transformer secondary terminals and the
            full-length coil. This design offered the lowest resistive losses, greatest thermal uniformity,
            and best alignment with PETD's theory of short, high-power pulses. It also brought us closest to
            the real-world conditions of a full ASHP coil system. The header image shows the bus bar connection.

            Driving these prototypes required delivering pulses of 110-120V AC at peak currents upwards of
            15A. To accomplish this safely, we designed a custom power supply unit (PSU) capable of
            switching AC pulses via a zero-cross triac circuit. The switching was controlled using an
            opto-isolated MOC3062, which allowed us to decouple the microcontroller logic (5V) from the AC
            load line. This ensured safety while allowing precise pulse timing control.
          </p>

          <p class="text bolder">
            Our original design used an ATmega328P for pulse control, paired with a logic-controlled gate
            for the triac trigger. We laid out and tested a dedicated PCB for the system, including heat
            dissipation considerations and snubber protection. Our PCB design followed IPC clearance and
            creepage guidelines for 240 AC mains. For field testing, however, we opted to use a commercial
            variac and an off-the-shelf triac control module to reduce the risk of catastrophic failure and
            to expedite testing outdoors. Below is the 3D model of our power supply with a custom PCB.
